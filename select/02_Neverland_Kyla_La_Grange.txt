If these are the last days of our youth
Then I wanna know that we went down burning
If this is the last I'll see of you
Then I wanna laugh till my face is hurting
Everybody's making babies
But I just wanna sit on your roof
And watch the city lights collide
Everybody's saying maybe
It's time to get a good job and prove
That you'd survive in real life
But I'm still staring in the mirror at 3am
Sad to wash the glitter off
And I'm still scared to make decisions, just breathing in
Hoping that I'm big enough
So go on tell me all the ways I could've been somebody
Show me how I'm not enough
(Can we keep pretending?)
So go on hit me in the face when I am feeling sorry
Tell me what I should've done
(Can we keep pretending?)
Coz I just wanna live in Neverland forever
With all my friends
If these were the best days of our lives
Then I wanna know that we kept them breathing
Gold lips and glances in the night
Give me your hand while your heart's still beating
When your memories are fading
This one will be phosphorescent, still alight
You were everyone's favourite
Shame you didn't see it till the closing line
But I'm still staring in the mirror at 3am
Sad to wash the glitter off
(Can we keep pretending?)
And I'm still scared to make decisions, just breathing in
Hoping that I'm big enough
(Can we keep pretending?)
So go on tell me all the ways I could've been somebody
Show me how I'm not enough
So go on hit me in the face when I am feeling sorry
Tell me what I should've done
Coz I just wanna live in Neverland forever
With all my friends
You make me feel like I'm forever young
And I'm still staring in the mirror at 3am
And I'm still scared to make decisions
Just breathing in
