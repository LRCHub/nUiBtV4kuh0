I will come to rest now
Wandered five hundred miles
There's no need to look back now
I won it five hundred times
Have to gather my strength now
At the end of this road
I am tattered and torn

I preferred you to [?]
Time has taken its toll
Still I don't feel repentant
No [?] after all
Have to put that aside now
When a new day awaits
I'll be striving for more

The rise, the fall, the meaning of all
In certainty all things will come to an end
I amend

In search for my neverland through the falling skies
I'm not asking why, all the time we spent passed by
Still in search for my neverland and the sands behind
I will always try, this will never end, my neverland and I

I see countless commandments
Expectations and rules
Still my life's what I make it
I am nobody's fool
I am freed and uncaged now
Every night you arise
[?] morning inside

The rise, the fall, the meaning of all
In certainty all things will come to an end
I amend

In search for my neverland through the falling skies
I'm not asking why, all the time we spent passed by
Still in search for my neverland and the sands behind
I will always try, this will never end, my neverland and I

The rise, the fall, the meaning of all
In certainty all things will come to an end
I amend

In search for my neverland through the falling skies
I'm not asking why, all the time we spent passed by
Still in search for my neverland and the sands behind
I will always try, this will never end, my neverland and I

In search for my neverland through the falling skies
I'm not asking why, all the time we spent passed by
Still in search for my neverland and the sands behind
I will always try, this will never end, my neverland and I
